# Pretrained Models

This folder is used to store pretrained models for the AST architecture. As such, instructions for how to setup the pretrained AST architecture are in the study's original repository: [AST: Audio Spectrogram Transformer](https://github.com/YuanGongND/ast)

For our experiments, we used AST's Full AudioSet, 10 tstride, 10 fstride, with Weight Averaging (0.459 mAP) model.
